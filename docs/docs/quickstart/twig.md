# **Templates (Twig)**

Twig is the standard templating language used by the Symfony framework.

It offers many useful and powerful features such as macros and template inheritance.

Melody limits the expressiveness provided by Twig in order to generate highly efficient DOM instructions. As a general rule of thumb, you should write valid HTML templates which contain Twig expressions.
